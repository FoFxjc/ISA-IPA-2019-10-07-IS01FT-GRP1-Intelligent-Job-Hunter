## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In the tide of globalization, the rapid flow of people, goods, information, and funds not only brought about the precision of the division of labor, but also caused the competition for resources among countries. Education competition is one of the most important part of it, all countries are facing unprecedented fierce competition in educational resources nowadays. To be specific, the competition for entering world-famous universities has changed from nationwide to global wide, which leads to the educational training institutions springing up.


Our team, consists of two Chinese students, all shuttled between different educational training institutions from childhood since Chinese education competition is one of the most fierce one in the worldwide. Although we do benefit a lot from it, we found that these institutions still have some common problems. Due to the large number of students, they tend to arrange same course length for different students which is unreasonable. Besides in some small institutions, teachers always need to do not only teaching but also arranging the curriculum schedule. Some of these institutions try to solve these questions by recruiting teaching assistant from college, since those teaching assistants always not profession enough, the effect is often not very good. Hence, we want to build an online intelligent teaching system for these educational training institutions.


The system is the Intelligent Teaching Assistant System (ITAS). Since it is built on a web-based application, both teacher and student can register and log in to the system. For teacher, he/she can set up the class, approve the students’ appointments for the class, trigger the scheduling process and check both all lessons arrangement and one specific student’s calendar. For students, they can apply for the class by submit their basic information and they can get the recommendation for the proper number of lessons generated by the system based on their existing skills and goals, and they can also check their own calendar after teacher finished all the process mentioned before.


To build the ITAS, which is a hybrid solution using the Vue.js, Flask, Spring Boot, Orange and OptaPlanner. We first extract the possible types of personal information which may influence the course length of one student should take to achieve the goal and design the questionnaire to collect the data for decision tree training, based on the rules generate, we finished built the recommendation part. For the function of reasonable scheduling, we build the domain model to further refine the acquired knowledge  from interviewing the institution’s teacher and identify the crux of requirements firstly, then we choose OptaPlanner as the constraint satisfaction engine to realize the scheduling process.


In this project, our team applied the knowledge and techniques acquired from the lectures and workshops into the reality business application scenario, and we would recommend our intelligent teaching assistant systems to every small and medium sized institutions, hoping it can help them improve the teaching efficiency and quality, help the students get better arrangement.
